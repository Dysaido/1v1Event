PvPEvent Plugin Announcement

This project started as a hobby to enhance my own Minecraft server development. Unable to find a solution that truly satisfied me on the internet, I decided to create and share PvPEvent - a powerful plugin designed to organize thrilling PVP events on Minecraft servers!

## Description

PvPEvent is a compact yet powerful add-on that allows you to host regular PVP events on your Minecraft servers. With PvPEvent, players can engage in intense arena battles or team-based skirmishes (please note that team-based battles are currently unavailable). Moreover, you have the freedom to customize event settings and rewards using the PvPEvent plugin (any tips on rewarding participants, activating commands for winners when the event concludes, etc. are much appreciated!).

## Key Features

- User-friendly and easy to install
- Offers flexible configuration options
- Supports the creation of custom arenas
- Customize arena capacities and countdown types per arena
- Automatic restarts and scheduling options (please note that these features are currently not available)

## Installation Guide

1. Download the PvPEvent plugin file from the [SpigotMC website](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/pvpevent.97786/).
2. Copy the plugin file into your server's "plugins" folder.
3. Restart the server to successfully load the plugin.
